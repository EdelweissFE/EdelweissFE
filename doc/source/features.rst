Features
========

EdelweissFE aims at an easy to understand, yet efficient implementation of the finite element method.
Some features are:

 * Python for non performance-critical routines
 * Cython for performance-critical routines
 * Parallelization
 * Modular system, which is easy to extend
 * Output to Paraview and Ensight via the Ensight Gold format, CSV, matplotlib
 * Interfaces to powerful direct and iterative linear solvers
